# One Piece - Characters network

![alt text](image.png)

## Overview
The One Piece world is amazing. But it's also huge : with over 1500 characters, it can become overwhelming. This project builds a character network based on shared crews, organizations, or even alliances to find patterns and make the world easier to understand, helping fans to better visualize the One Piece world.


## Getting Started

### üõ†Ô∏è Data extraction and creation

I used the [Crawl4AI](https://docs.crawl4ai.com/) framework to automate the extraction of structured data from the One Piece Fandom Wiki.

1. **Character list extraction**  
   I targeted the [List of Canon Characters](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_Canon_Characters) page using a custom CSS schema to extract character names and their profile URLs. For each character URL, I navigated to their dedicated wiki page and extracted infobox attributes such as affiliations, occupations, origin, and more.


## IN PROGRESS
